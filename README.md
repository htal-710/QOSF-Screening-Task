This repositry contains my solution for the screening tasks of QOSF (Cohort 10).
I attempted the Task 1, which can be viewed in Task1.ipynb.


I started by attempting Task 2, as it is closer to the topics I am intersted in t doing, however couldn't complete it. I was able to 
1) add noise in the circuit
2) transiple to the universal gates
3) Create QFT from scratch
   bit unable to complile it to create a draper adder

So I decided to complete Task1 for submission
